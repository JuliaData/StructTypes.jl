If a type is defined as StructTypes.Struct, it defaults to StructTypes.UnorderedStruct, which means its fields are allowed to be serialized/deserialized in any order, as opposed to StructTypes.OrderedStruct which signals that serialization/deserialization must occur in its defined field order exclusively. This can enable optimizations when an order can be guaranteed, but care must be taken to ensure any serialization formats can properly guarantee the order (for example, the JSON specification doesn't explicitly require ordered fields for \"objects\", though most implementations have a way to support this).\n\nFor StructTypes.UnorderedStruct, if a field is missing from the serialization, nothing should be passed to the StructTypes.construct method.\n\nFor example, when deserializing a Struct.OrderedStruct, parsed input fields are passed directly, in input order to the T constructor, like T(field1, field2, field3). This means that field names may be ignored when deserializing; fields are directly passed to T in the order they're encountered.\n\nAnother example, for reading a StructTypes.OrderedStruct() from a JSON string input, each key-value pair is read in the order it is encountered in the JSON input, the keys are ignored, and the values are directly passed to the type at the end of the object parsing like T(val1, val2, val3). Yes, the JSON specification says that Objects are specifically un-ordered collections of key-value pairs, but the truth is that many JSON libraries provide ways to maintain JSON Object key-value pair order when reading/writing. Because of the minimal processing done while parsing, and the \"trusting\" that the Julia type constructor will be able to handle fields being present, missing, or even extra fields that should be ignored, this is the fastest possible method for mapping a JSON input to a Julia structure. If your workflow interacts with non-Julia APIs for sending/receiving JSON, you should take care to test and confirm the use of StructTypes.OrderedStruct() in the cases mentioned above: what if a field is missing when parsing? what if the key-value pairs are out of order? what if there extra fields get included that weren't anticipated? If your workflow is questionable on these points, or it would be too difficult to account for these scenarios in your type constructor, it would be better to consider the StructTypes.UnorderedStruct or StructTypes.Mutable() options.\n\nstruct CoolType\n    val1::Int\n    val2::Int\n    val3::String\nend\n\nStructTypes.StructType(::Type{CoolType}) = StructTypes.OrderedStruct()\n\n# JSON3 package as example\n@assert JSON3.read(\"{\"val1\": 1, \"val2\": 2, \"val3\": 3}\", CoolType) == CoolType(1, 2, \"3\")\n# note how `val2` field is first, then `val1`, but fields are passed *in-order* to `CoolType` constructor; BE CAREFUL!\n@assert JSON3.read(\"{\"val2\": 2, \"val1\": 1, \"val3\": 3}\", CoolType) == CoolType(2, 1, \"3\")\n# if we instead define `Struct`, which defaults to `StructTypes.UnorderedStruct`, then the above example works\nStructTypes.StructType(::Type{CoolType}) = StructTypes.Struct()\n@assert JSON3.read(\"{\"val2\": 2, \"val1\": 1, \"val3\": 3}\", CoolType) == CoolType(1, 2, \"3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#StructTypes.Mutable","page":"Home","title":"StructTypes.Mutable","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"StructTypes.Mutable","category":"page"},{"location":"#StructTypes.Mutable","page":"Home","title":"StructTypes.Mutable","text":"StructTypes.StructType(::Type{T}) = StructTypes.Mutable()\n\nSignal that T is a mutable struct with an empty constructor for serializing/deserializing. Though slightly less performant than StructTypes.Struct, Mutable is a much more robust method for mapping Julia struct fields for serialization. This technique requires your Julia type to be defined, at a minimum, like:\n\nmutable struct T\n    field1\n    field2\n    field3\n    # etc.\n\n    T() = new()\nend\n\nNote specifically that we're defining a mutable struct to allow field mutation, and providing a T() = new() inner constructor which constructs an \"empty\" T where isbitstype fields will be randomly initialized, and reference fields will be #undef. (Note that the inner constructor doesn't need to be exactly this, but at least needs to be callable like T(). If certain fields need to be intialized or zeroed out for security, then this should be accounted for in the inner constructor). For these mutable types, the type will first be initizlied like T(), then serialization will take each key-value input pair, setting the field as the key is encountered, and converting the value to the appropriate field value. This flow has the nice properties of: allowing object construction success even if fields are missing in the input, and if \"extra\" fields exist in the input that aren't apart of the Julia struct's fields, they will automatically be ignored. This allows for maximum robustness when mapping Julia types to arbitrary data foramts that may be generated via web services, databases, other language libraries, etc.\n\nThere are a few additional helper methods that can be utilized by StructTypes.Mutable() types to hand-tune field reading/writing behavior:\n\nStructTypes.names(::Type{T}) = ((:juliafield1, :serializedfield1), (:juliafield2, :serializedfield2)): provides a mapping of Julia field name to expected serialized object key name. This affects both serializing and deserializing. When deserializing the serializedfield1 key, the juliafield1 field of T will be set. When serializing the juliafield2 field of T, the output key will be serializedfield2. Field name mappings are provided as a Tuple of Tuple{Symbol, Symbol}s, i.e. each field mapping is a Julia field name Symbol (first) and serialized field name Symbol (second).\nStructTypes.excludes(::Type{T}) = (:field1, :field2): specify fields of T to ignore when serializing and deserializing, provided as a Tuple of Symbols. When deserializing, if field1 is encountered as an input key, it's value will be read, but the field will not be set in T. When serializing, field1 will be skipped when serializing out T fields as key-value pairs.\nStructTypes.omitempties(::Type{T}) = (:field1, :field2): specify fields of T that shouldn't be serialized if they are \"empty\", provided as a Tuple of Symbols. This only affects serializing. If a field is a collection (AbstractDict, AbstractArray, etc.) and isempty(x) === true, then it will not be serialized. If a field is #undef, it will not be serialized. If a field is nothing, it will not be serialized. To apply this to all fields of T, set StructTypes.omitempties(::Type{T}) = true. You can customize this behavior. For example, by default, missing is not considered to be \"empty\". If you want missing to be considered \"empty\" when serializing your type MyType, simply define:\n\n@inline StructTypes.isempty(::Type{T}, ::Missing) where {T <: MyType} = true\n\nStructTypes.keywordargs(::Type{T}) = (field1=(dateformat=dateformat\"mm/dd/yyyy\",), field2=(dateformat=dateformat\"HH MM SS\",)): provide keyword arguments for fields of type T that should be passed to functions that set values for this field.

Note that keyword arguments can be passed when reading, like JSON3.read(source, MyType; dateformat=...) and they will be passed down to each StructTypes.construct method.

Note the default definition is StructTypes.fieldprefix(T, nm) = Symbol(nm, :_).\n\nHere's a more concrete, albeit contrived, example:\n\nstruct Spouse\n    id::Int\n    name::String\nend\n\nStructTypes.StructType(::Type{Spouse}) = StructTypes.Struct()\n\nstruct Person\n    id::Int\n    name::String\n    spouse::Spouse\nend\n\nStructTypes.StructType(::Type{Person}) = StructTypes.Struct()\nStructTypes.fieldprefix(::Type{Person}, field::Symbol) = field == :spouse ? :spouse_ : :_\n\nHere we have two structs, Spouse and Person, and a Person has a spouse::Spouse. The database tables to represent these entities might look like:\n\nCREATE TABLE spouse (id INT, name VARCHAR);\nCREATE TABLE person (id INT, name VARCHAR, spouse_id INT);\n\nIf we want to leverage a package like Strapping.jl to automatically handle the object construction for us, we could write a get query like the following to ensure a full Person with field spouse::Spouse can be constructed:\n\ngetPerson(id::Int) = Strapping.construct(Person, DBInterface.execute(db,\n    \"\"\"\n        SELECT person.id as id, person.name as name, spouse.id as spouse_id, spouse.name as spouse_name\n        FROM person\n        LEFT JOIN spouse ON person.spouse_id = spouse.id\n        WHERE person.id = $id\n    \"\"\"))\n\nThis works because the column names in the resultset of this query are \"id, name, spouseid, spousename\"; because we defined StructTypes.fieldprefix for Person, Strapping.jl knows that each column starting with \"spouse_\" should be used in constructing the Spouse field of Person.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Interface-Types","page":"Home","title":"Interface Types","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"For interface types, we don't want the internal fields of a type exposed, so an alternative API is to define the closest \"basic\" type that our custom type should map to.

In addition to the StructType definition, we also define StructTypes.subtypekey(::Type{Vehicle}) = :type, which signals that when deserializing, when it encounters the type key, it should use the value, in the above example: car, to discover the appropriate concrete subtype to parse the structure as, in this case Car. The mapping of subtype key value to concrete Julia subtype is defined in our example via StructTypes.subtypes(::Type{Vehicle}) = (car=Car, truck=Truck). Thus, StructTypes.AbstractType is useful when the object to deserialize includes a \"subtype\" key-value pair that can be used to parse a specific, concrete type; in our example, parsing the structure as a Car instead of a Truck.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Utilities","page":"Home","title":"Utilities","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Several utility functions are provided for fellow package authors wishing to utilize the StructTypes.StructType trait to integrate in their package.
